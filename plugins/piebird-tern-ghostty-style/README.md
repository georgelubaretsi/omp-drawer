# piebird-tern-ghostty-style

omp in [Tern](https://docs.stencil.so/tern/), drawn the way omp looks in Ghostty: one box per
tool call, thoughts left open, bash as `$ command`, compact diffs and replies. Rendered Markdown
files get room for wide tables.

[![The same omp session in Tern's own look, then in the Ghostty style](../../demos/piebird-tern-ghostty-style/demo.webp)](../../demos/piebird-tern-ghostty-style/demo.mp4)

## Install

    omp plugin marketplace add georgelubaretsi/piebird
    omp plugin install piebird-tern-ghostty-style@piebird

The look is a Tern plugin (`so.stencil.tern/`, style sheets only); omp brings it along. The next
time omp starts in a Tern pane, it installs the look into Tern and says so in the chat; after
`omp plugin upgrade` it updates it the same way; turned off in Tern's settings, it is left alone.
To go back to Tern's own look, uninstall this plugin first
(`omp plugin uninstall piebird-tern-ghostty-style`), then remove the look from Tern
(`tern plugin remove piebird-tern-ghostty-style`); the other way round, omp installs it again.

The agent gets nothing from this plugin.
