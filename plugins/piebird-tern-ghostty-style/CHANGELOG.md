## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Tern plugin `piebird-tern-ghostty-style` (folder `so.stencil.tern/`), a look: style sheets that draw
  omp's chat in Tern's Reader chat style the way omp looks in Ghostty: one box per tool call
  with its heading (title, intent) inside, eval cells included; thoughts left open under their
  "Thought for Ns" line; bash as `$ command`; diffs with one line-number column; your messages
  as full-width bars, denser replies and text in omp dark-arctic's colours. Outside omp,
  rendered Markdown in file panes gets a column up to 1200px instead of Tern's 832px, so wide
  tables and diagrams aren't cut while the pane stays empty around them. It needs Tern 0.7.1 or
  later.
- omp installs the look: when omp starts as the main agent in a local Tern pane, it installs
  the Tern plugin if Tern lacks it, replaces a copy of another version (after a plugin upgrade),
  and says so in the chat. A linked copy and one turned off in Tern's settings are left alone.
- Supported hosts: omp, and Tern through omp.
- README, with a demo video: the same omp session in Tern's own look, then in this one.
