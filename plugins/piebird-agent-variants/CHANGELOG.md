# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/2.0.0/),
and this plugin adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Tool `agent_variant_setup`: when you ask to run work with a particular model, provider, cost
  limit or thinking level, it creates a temporary copy of an existing agent (such as `task`,
  `reviewer` or `designer`) routed to that model. It configures the variant; you then use it.
- Model matching from a natural request or exact selector, with fallback models; free and
  subscription-backed routes are used first, and paid per-token models need your explicit
  approval, with their prices shown.
- Project scope by default (`.omp/` in the repository), written only after the agent confirms
  the project allows it; global scope only when you ask for it.
- Protects your configuration: refuses to overwrite uncommitted `.omp` changes, existing
  non-temporary agents or roles, and updates an existing temporary variant only when asked.
- Lists the project's temporary agents, with their source agent and requested model, when a
  session starts.
- Every word the model reads (the tool's description, results and errors, the description
  written into a variant) is in `core/model.ftl`; [what the model sees](../../docs/model/piebird-agent-variants.md)
  shows each, word for word.
- Supported host: omp.
- Carries its YAML library (`vendor/yaml/`, `yaml` 2, ISC), as omp installs no packages for a
  marketplace plugin, so it loads installed from the marketplace or the desktop installer.
- README, with a demo video: omp makes a temporary reviewer on Claude Haiku and hands it a
  review.

### Changed

- `agent_variant_setup` failing in the plugin's own code tells the model so in the plugin's
  words (`error-crashed` in `core/model.ftl`).
- Without project write approval, `agent_variant_setup` says how to check: the repository's
  instruction files (`git ls-files`) and `git status` on `.omp`; with changes not committed there,
  as when it refuses to write over them, it says to tell the user rather than work around it
  (editing `.omp` files itself, or another scope); otherwise, the call to make
  (`projectWriteApproved: true`). Once configured, it says the variant is ready, to be set up
  again only when the user asks for a change.
- Renamed from `agent-variants` to `piebird-agent-variants`, one name for the folder, `plugin.json`,
  `package.json` and the catalog: install it as `piebird-agent-variants@piebird`.
- A provider you're signed in to with OAuth (a Claude, ChatGPT or Copilot subscription) counts
  as a subscription, the way omp's status line counts it, so its models are used without a
  question; before, every route with a price needed your approval unless you said
  "subscription". A provider signed in with an API key and a price still needs your approval.
